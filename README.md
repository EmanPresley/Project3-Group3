# Project 3 Overview :space_invader:
The purpose of Project 3 was to collaborate as a group to implement two component competencies of Data Science: data visualizations and data engineering. On the data engineering side, we began by choosing a topic that would be of interest to a large number of people around the world: Gaming! Next, we combed through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for datasets that included enough gaming and location data to host an interactive map on our Dashboard Landing page. Given the limited number of open data sets that integrated both criteria, we were charged with the challenge of locating and analyzing multiple datasets where at least one of the criteria was discussed in detail. Ultimately, we settled on two data sets, "List of Game Studios in Europe and CIS 2020" and "Popular Video Games 1980-2023." Finally, we cleaned and merged the two datasets, queried the data, built a full-stack web application, and created appropriate visualizations to tell an exciting, yet effective story about gaming around the world in a [Canva Slide Deck Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAF7Ipfo8B0/95Spdrl_hyPLv7MiiKgmmg/edit?utm_content=DAF7Ipfo8B0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton). 

# Analysis :memo:
Fun knows no borders! With that premise in mind, we wanted to take an in-depth look at a hobby that has brought people from various cultures together from around the world. Gaming can be viewed as one of the “great equalizers” of our society. It has the power to blend diverse narratives, characters, gameplay styles, and epic adventures--connecting people who otherwise may never have interacted with one another in their entire lifetime. Feel free to access our project [Analytics Write-Up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4lET3ghirVR62TO4xrk8higNJYCVZgar5o_d7W8TzQ/edit?usp=sharing)PDF to learn more about the Datasets, our ETL, Web App and Dashboard creation methods, Limitation, Bias, Future Work, and Works Cited. Game On!
